#Â Submissions API

Submissions is a feed of changes that have happened to the learning record. A new record is added to the API everytime a significant change occurs, and will only include details of what has changed since the last event. The first event for a record will include all details.

## Gettings submissions

Getting submissions can be done by consuming the following URI:

    GET https://host:port/api/submissions?sinceEventId={since_event_id}&sinceTime={since_time}&ukprn={ukprn}&page={page_number}
    
Where:
* since_event_id = (Optional) The event id that you want to read from. This is non-inclusive.
* since_time = (Optional) The time that you want to read from. This is non-inclusive.
* ukprn = (Optional) learning provider ukprn to filter by, i.e. 12345. Default is null / no filter.
* page_number = (Optional) page number to display, i.e. 10. Default is 1

Note: You may specify since_event_id, since_time or neither. You may not specify both.

## Using the client

A .NET client also exists to easy calling the api and encapsulates the authentication and deserialization. It can be added from nuget:

```powershell
Install-Package SFA.DAS.Provider.Events.Api.Client
```

And then called by:

```csharp
var config = new PaymentsEventsApiConfiguration
{
    ClientToken = "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN",
    ApiBaseUrl = "https://some-server/"
};
var client = new PaymentsEventsApiClient(config);
var submissions = await client.GetSubmissionEvents();
// The above also optionally takes sinceEventId, sinceTime, ukprn and page, e.g.
// var submissions = await client.GetSubmissionEvents(sinceEventId: 123, page: 2);
// var submissions = await client.GetSubmissionEvents(sinceTime: lastPollTime, page: 2);
// var submissions = await client.GetSubmissionEvents(ukprn: 456, page: 2);
```
